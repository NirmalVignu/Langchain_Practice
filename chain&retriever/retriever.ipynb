       "Document(page_content='sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.', metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 1})"

       "\"Based on the provided context, the question is likely related to the Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism used in the Transformer model. The context mentions that the Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost. This suggests that the Transformer may be using an attention mechanism that is more efficient or effective than previous models, which could be due to the Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism.\\n\\nTo answer this question, we can analyze the context and identify the key features of the attention mechanism used in the Transformer. The context mentions that the attention function maps a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. This suggests that the attention mechanism is using a dot product attention mechanism, where the query and keys are dot products of each other.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that the Transformer uses scaled dot-product attention, which means that the dot product attention is scaled by a scalar value. This scalar value could be a learnable parameter or a fixed value that is shared across all attention layers in the model. By scaling the dot product attention, the Transformer can control the amount of attention paid to different parts of the input sequence, which can help improve the model's performance on the task at hand.\\n\\nOverall, the Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism used in the Transformer is a key component that contributes to its superior performance compared to previous models. By scaling the dot product attention, the Transformer can effectively weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence and generate more accurate translations.\""
